# Task Four: Sum of Even Numbers
# Scenario:

# Create a Python script that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a user-defined range.
# The user will provide the start and end values of the range, and the script will use a for loop to iterate through this range and compute the sum of the even numbers.

# Objective:

# Encapsulate the logic for summing even numbers within a method.
# The script should prompt the user to enter the start and end values of the range, and then use the method to print the sum of the even numbers within that range.

# Steps to Complete the Task:

# Define a Method:
# Create a method named sum_of_even_numbers that takes two parameters: start and end.
# Inside the method, use a for loop to iterate through the range from start to end (inclusive) and calculate the sum of all even numbers.
# User Input:
# In the main part of the script, prompt the user to enter the start and end values of the range.
# Call the Method:
# Pass the user-provided range values to the sum_of_even_numbers method to compute and print the sum of even numbers.
