# Task 17: Basic Calculator with Error Handling
# Objective:

# Create a simple calculator program that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# The program should also handle errors, such as division by zero or invalid input, gracefully.

# Instructions:

# Provide a menu with the following options:
# Addition
# Subtraction
# Multiplication
# Division
# Exit

# Implement the functionality for each operation using if statements and loops. The program should continue running until the user chooses to exit.
# Handle errors like division by zero and invalid input using try-except blocks.
# After each operation, display the result and allow the user to perform another calculation or exit.

# Menu Example:
# ================================================================================
# Basic Calculator:
# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division
# 5. Exit
# ================================================================================

# Functionality Details:

# Addition:
# Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
# Perform the addition and display the result.
# Subtraction:
# Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
# Perform the subtraction and display the result.
# Multiplication:
# Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
# Perform the multiplication and display the result.
# Division:
# Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
# Perform the division and display the result.
# Handle division by zero by displaying an error message instead of crashing.
# Exit:
# Exit the program.

# Example Usage:
# ================================================================================
# Basic Calculator:
# 1. Addition
# 2. Subtraction
# 3. Multiplication
# 4. Division
# 5. Exit

# Enter your choice: 1
# Enter the first number: 15
# Enter the second number: 10
# Result: 25

# Enter your choice: 4
# Enter the first number: 20
# Enter the second number: 0
# Error: Division by zero is not allowed.

# Enter your choice: 5
# Goodbye!
# ================================================================================

# This task will help you practice basic arithmetic operations, working with user input, and handling errors in your programs.
# It's also a good exercise in making your program user-friendly by ensuring it doesn't crash when faced with unexpected input.
