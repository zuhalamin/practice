# Task 13: Inventory Management System
# Objective:

# Create a program that allows the user to manage an inventory of items in a store. The program should allow the user to add items, update quantities, view all items, and search for items by name.

# Instructions:

# Initialize an empty dictionary to store the inventory. The keys should be the item names (strings),
# and the values should be dictionaries containing the following information:
# "quantity": An integer representing the quantity of the item in stock.
# "price": A float representing the price of the item.

# Provide a menu with the following options:
# Add a new item
# Update item quantity
# View all items
# Search for an item by name
# Exit

# Implement the functionality for each menu option using if statements and loops.
# The program should keep running until the user chooses to exit.
# Menu Example:
# ================================================================================================
# Inventory Management Menu:
# 1. Add a new item
# 2. Update item quantity
# 3. View all items
# 4. Search for an item by name
# 5. Exit
# ================================================================================================

# Functionality Details:
# Add a new item:
# Prompt the user to enter the item name, quantity, and price.
# If the item already exists, inform the user and update the existing item.
# Add the item to the dictionary.
# Update item quantity:
# Prompt the user to enter the item name and the new quantity.
# If the item exists, update its quantity.
# If the item does not exist, inform the user.
# View all items:
# Print all items in the dictionary with their name, quantity, and price.
# Search for an item by name:
# Prompt the user to enter the item name.
# Print the item's details if it exists in the dictionary.
# If the item does not exist, inform the user.
# Exit:
# Exit the program.

# Example:
# ================================================================================================
# Inventory Management Menu:
# 1. Add a new item
# 2. Update item quantity
# 3. View all items
# 4. Search for an item by name

# Enter item name: Apples
# Apples - Quantity: 75, Price: $0.99
