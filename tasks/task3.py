# Task Three: Determine Age Group
# Create a Python script that determines the age group of a person based on their age.
# The script should classify the person into one of the following categories:

# "Child" (0-12 years)
# "Teen" (13-19 years)
# "Adult" (20-64 years)
# "Senior" (65 years and above)

# Objective:
# Encapsulate the logic for determining the age group into a method.
# The script should prompt the user to enter their age and then use the method to print the appropriate age group.

# Steps to Complete the Task:

# Define a Method:
# Create a method named determine_age_group that takes one parameter: age.
# Inside the method, use if, elif, and else statements to determine the age group based on the given age.
# User Input:
# In the main part of the script, prompt the user to enter their age.
# Call the Method:
# Pass the user-provided age to the determine_age_group method to determine and print the age group.
