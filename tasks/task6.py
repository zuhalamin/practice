# Task Five: Find the Maximum and Minimum in a List
# Scenario:

# Create a Python script that finds and prints the maximum and minimum values in a list of numbers provided by the user.
# The script should handle user input, convert it into a list of numbers, and then use a method to determine the maximum and minimum values in the list.

# Objective:

# Encapsulate the logic for finding the maximum and minimum values within a method. The script should prompt the user to enter a list of numbers (comma-separated), and then use the method to print the maximum and minimum values in that list.

# Steps to Complete the Task:

# Define a Method:
# Create a method named find_max_and_min that takes one parameter: numbers_list.
# Inside the method, use built-in Python functions to determine the maximum and minimum values in the list.
# User Input:
# In the main part of the script, prompt the user to enter a list of numbers (comma-separated).
# Process Input:
# Convert the user input into a list of numbers.
# Call the Method:
# Pass the list of numbers to the find_max_and_min method to compute and print the maximum and minimum values.

# Summary:
# This task demonstrates how to work with lists in Python.
# It shows how to take user input, process it into a list, and then use a method to find and print the maximum and minimum values in the list.
# This approach promotes code modularity and reusability.
